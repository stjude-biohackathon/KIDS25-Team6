# Upload training data here. We need SMILES of complex, large molecules, paired with a 2D representation of the molecule. 

## Example training set
An example training set is located in Training-Data/test_mini. It is composed of a csv file containing image file paths and corresponding SMILES (see Training-Data/test_mini/test_mini.csv)
