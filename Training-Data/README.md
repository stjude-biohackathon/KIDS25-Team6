# Upload training data here. We need SMILES of complex, large molecules, paired with a 2D representation of the molecule. 


# ML Modelling
The implementation of the ML model to predict SMILES strings from single images is located in the ML_model subfolder.

## Model fine-tuning
Coming soon

## Model evaluation
Coming soon

## Model inference interface
Coming soon
